# PyGDGen

PyGDGen is a Python package designed for optimizing the configuration of clusters with diverse shapes, including custom geometries. Leveraging gradient descent, it offers efficient solutions for generating condensed configurations and allows for the customization of constraint boxes.

## Key Features

- **Optimization for Multiple and Customized Clusters**: Tailored to handle a variety of cluster shapes.
- **Dense Configuration Generation**: Capable of producing highly condensed configurations, surpassing traditional random generation methods.
- **Customizable Constraint Boxes**: Users can define their own constraint environments, including periodic conditions, neck-like structures, or non-periodic settings.
- **Versatile Application**: Ideal for building atomic configurations for first principle calculations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and finite element simulation structures.

## Installation

To install PyGDGen, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install pygdgen
