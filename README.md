# PyGDGen - Python Gradient Descent Generator for Atomic Configuration
PyGDGen, standing for Python Gradient Descent Generator, is a Python package that specializes in optimizing the configuration of clusters with diverse shapes using gradient descent techniques. This tool is adept at creating condensed configurations and allows for extensive customization of constraint boxes for various scientific and engineering applications.

## Features
- **Gradient Descent Optimization**: Uses gradient descent methods for precise and efficient optimization of cluster shapes.
- **Versatile Cluster Shape Handling**: Capable of optimizing multiple and customized cluster shapes.
- **Dense Configuration Generation**: Generates highly condensed configurations, surpassing the capabilities of traditional random generation methods.
- **Customizable Constraint Boxes**: Supports user-defined constraint environments, including periodic conditions, neck-like structures, or non-periodic environments.
- **Wide Application Range**: Ideal for first principle calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and finite element simulation structures.
